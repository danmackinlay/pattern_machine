=======================

Some quarks for use in Supercollider_ by `Parking Sun`_ [#]_.

At there moment, there is

* a JSON_ decoder. It might need some love w/regard to malformed markup
  handling.
* some miscellaneous utilities for my coding style. ("sun_convenience")

Although no code of his was used, `Patrick van Bergen's post`_ about JSON
parsing in c# was bloody handy. Tests were inspired by (although in the end not re-used from) `json-sans-eval`_
