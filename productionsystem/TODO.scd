/*************
 * TODO
 *************

 * Use my lovely POp class's ability to collapse
 * Should collections be a synonym for PSBranch?
 * Stochastic factories, producing Affine transforms (or, more conveniently, POps) to desired specs
 * make POp editable
 	* Refactor POp to use a dict internally, since I end up casting to it all the time anyway.
 * pump events to some external OSC thing for visualising, perhaps with a PFunc
 * make moombahton
 * a pattern library for PSProductionSystem
